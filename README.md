# Reuters-articles-classification
This is a simple text classification task, using a multi-layer preceptron neural network as a baseline model (the model can be improved through a recurrent neural network approach, since the time is naturally organized as a time series that could benefit from this type of architectures).

Here you can find both the handling of the raw data as well as the modelling of the problem itself. 

The data is publicly available at http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/
